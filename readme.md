The aim of this file is to capture how to setup cmdstanr to run with brms 
(rather than rstan).

AFAIK, using cmdstanr might be better than using rstan anyway (see links in 
section 1 of the setup_cmdstanr.Rmd or .html file). Cmdstanr is lightweight and 
is kept up-to-date more frequently compared to rstan, which is released via CRAN. 
So using cmdstan and cmdstanr seems like the way to go forward in the future.

But I'm not 100% sure, tbh.
